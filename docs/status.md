## Status

We are currently working on features necessary to play Diablo 2 in its entirety. After this is completed, we will work on expanding the project to include tools and plugin support for modding, as well as writing completely new games with the engine.

At the moment (March 2021) the game starts, you can select any character and run around Act1 town.
You can also open any of the game's panels.

Much work has been made in the background, but a lot of work still has to be done for the game to be playable.

Feel free to contribute!
