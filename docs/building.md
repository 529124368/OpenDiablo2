## Building

To pull the project down, run `go get github.com/OpenDiablo2/OpenDiablo2`

On windows this folder will most likely be in `%USERPROFILE%\go\src\github.com\OpenDiablo2\OpenDiablo2`

In the root folder, run `go get -d` to pull down all dependencies.

To run the project, run `go run .` from the root folder.

You can also open the root folder in VSCode. Make sure you have the `ms-vscode.go` plugin installed.

### Linux

There are several dependencies which need to be installed additionally.
To install them you can use `./build.sh` in the project root folder - this script takes care of the installation for you.

### Windows

### MacOS
